- abstract: "<p>Annotating and adding rich information to layers of items in a IIIF\
    \ canvas can be challenging, especially when trying to add types of data that\
    \ are not inherent to the functionality of IIIF or implemented by existing clients.\
    \ Heritage science data is often specific to layers \u2013 as with scientific\
    \ and spectral imaging \u2013 and adding these annotations per layer, not at the\
    \ canvas level, requires additional functionality that would be useful for many\
    \ other image assessment applications. \nHeritage science data also benefits greatly\
    \ from LOUD practices; we have been exploring options for utilizing linked data\
    \ resources in IIIF annotation contexts, including LinkedArt, Getty Vocabs, SemanticScience\
    \ Integrated Ontology, and numerous Bio/Life Science ontologies. Incorporating\
    \ data types inherent to heritage science has raised numerous challenges, not\
    \ least being how to express an appropriately typed measurement (despite the CIDOC\
    \ CRM presence behind LinkedArt), and wanting to use authoritative scientific\
    \ sources that are not in fact true LD resources. The presentation will include\
    \ a quick demonstration of Mirador 3 with layer annotations - a proof of concept\
    \ mod/plugin and also illustrating structured datasets with a blend of LinkedArt\
    \ and SIO.</p><p></p>"
