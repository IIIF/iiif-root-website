title: International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)
---
<p class="lookatme">IIIF is an open software standard for delivering high quality, attributed digital objects (like image and audio/visual files) online at scale. It's also the international community of people developing and implementing the IIIF APIs.</p>  

<p class="lookatme">IIIF is stewarded by a [consortium]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/consortium/).</p>


## Great for researchers

Access, examine, compare, and annotate high-quality images and audio/visual files, then share your work with others. IIIF enables easy viewing of large images from multiple repositories, with tools to aid research and presentation.

## Efficient for developers

Publish once, use often! IIIF lets you serve digital objects to your own site, or to sites using IIIF anywhere in the world--all while giving users a high-quality viewing experience for multiple file types.

## Powerful *and* practical for leaders

Share your collections as widely as possible. IIIF is being adopted by global leading institutions as a cost-effective way to serve billions of digital objects online without vendor lock-in and with strong open-source, community-driven ethics.

## Try it yourself

IIIF can unite materials from one or many collections, allowing users to zoom, pan, and add additional images for comparison. It also allows annotations and multi-layer viewing, among many other options.

First time exploring IIIF? Here's a simple, zoomable example of a single text page with annotations. Give it a try!
