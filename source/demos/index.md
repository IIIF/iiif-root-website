It’s usually better to try a few working examples when you’re trying to get your head around a new technology, so we’ve gathered some demos for you that cover the two key areas of the way IIIF works: [IIIF Viewers]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/demos/iiif_viewers/) and [Image Servers]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/demos/image_servers/). We’ve included some demos built by the community that are [just for fun]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/demos/experiments_and_fun), too!

You should definitely check out the [Awesome IIIF page on Github](https://github.com/IIIF/awesome-iiif). That’s a community-driven compendium of all things IIIF, and there’s a ton of stuff to explore.
