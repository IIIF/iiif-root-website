## Workshop overview

During the five-day workshop, participants will follow the [online workshop materials](https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/), including watching videos on the Image, Presentation APIs, and using annotations with IIIF.  

Support will be given by the IIIF Technical Coordinator in the form of a group Slack channel, daily group check-in sessions, and 1-on-1 meetings. Participants will be encouraged to bring their own images to the workshop and work on a project during the week putting in to practice what they are learning. These will be demoed to other participants on the last day of the workshop.

After this class, participants will be able to:
- Run a local image server
- Annotate IIIF images
- Build a IIIF Presentation manifest using the Bodleian Manifest editor
- Relate existing applications of IIIF to local user needs

## Fellowship seats

The IIIF Consortium is committed to accessibility, inclusivity, and reducing barriers to learn about IIIF. We know that institutions have differing policies and abilities regarding support for staff training and development, and don't want potential IIIF users excluded because of issues like these.

To counter this, we make make a set number of seats in every online workshop available as fellowship tickets with no cost to the attendee. This a tangible means by which the IIIF Consortium can encourage participation from a more diverse body of institutions.

Fellowship seats are first-come, first-served, and made available via the honor system; we do not require any documentation to claim these tickets. If you count yourself among the groups listed below and your institution does not have funding for training opportunities, then these fellowship seats are available to you.

Candidates from under-represented groups in the IIIF Community -- including but not limited to:
- people of color, ability/disability, non-binary gender identities, etc., as well as members of underrepresented and/or marginalized groups that don’t fit into these categories
- Attendees from under-represented countries and geographic regions, particularly the Global South

To claim a fellowship seat, register for a workshop on the event's EventBrite page and select the "fellowship ticket" option from the drop down menu.

## Time commitment and expectations

Participants will typically need to dedicate 3-4 hours a day to the workshop and follow the material for one topic per day.

Participants are expected to attend the Monday and Friday meetings in real time, and may drop in on the mid-week check-in meetings to meet other participants and discuss ideas or issues.

Participants will need a laptop on which they can install software. They will need to install Zoom, [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/) and various workshop specific tools.

In addition to the core sessions listed above there are a number of guest presentations that were recorded during our first online workshop available in the [Workshop notes](https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/GuestPresentations.html). If participants are interested in learning about other tools we will try and source additional guest presentations during the week. These sessions will be recorded for later viewing by participants that can’t make these extra calls.
