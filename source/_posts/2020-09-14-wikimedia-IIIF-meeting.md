Exciting news: Wikimedia Foundation is scoping the implementation of IIIF on Wikimedia Commons! They will be hosting two meetings along with IIIF Wikimedia Ambassadors to discuss the project and allow GLAM professionals to share their experiences of IIIF. We encourage IIIF community members to join to contribute use cases.

- [September 21, 2020, 3:30-4:30pm UTC](https://wikimedia.zoom.us/j/92494570141)

From the Wikimedia Foundation folks:
> We will be joined by Evan Prodromou, Product Manager in the Wikimedia Foundation's Platform team for the first meeting, and will play a recording of his intro when we repeat the meeting on Tuesday. Evan is scoping the implementation of International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) on Wikimedia Commons and he is very interested in potential GLAM use cases. I also plan to have a GLAM speaker at each meeting to share their experience of IIIF.

Reach out to us at <staff@iiif.io> with any questions.
