The IIIF Consortium is excited to be supporting the [#VisibleWikiWomen 2020 campaign](https://whoseknowledge.org/initiatives/visiblewikiwomen-2020/) hosted by [Whose Knowledge?](https://whoseknowledge.org/), running through May 8, 2020.

The campaign is an effort to improve the representation of influential women -- especially black, brown and indigenous women -- on Wikipedia by adding openly licensed images to Wikimedia Commons.

We're hopeful that institutions among our membership base will consider making valuable reuse of the curation, digitization, and rights review efforts they've already undertaken to identify openly licensed images that fit the criteria for this campaign. The team at Whose Knowledge? has helpfully created a resource titled "[Guide for Cultural and Memory Institutions to make women visible on Wikipedia](https://whoseknowledge.org/resource/glam-guide/)."

More details about participating in the program are included below.

Please reach out to [staff@iiif.io](mailto:staff@iiif.io) if you have any questions about how you can participate in this campaign, and thanks as always for all your support!

Through 8 May, [Whose Knowledge?](https://whoseknowledge.org/) is hosting the [[#VisibleWikiWomen 2020 campaign](https://whoseknowledge.org/initiatives/visiblewikiwomen-2020/)! This is the third edition of the campaign and thanks to their partners and friends they've brought over 8000 images of notable women to Wikipedia and the broader internet during two last years.

Yet, there is so much more to be done as Wikipedia (and the broader internet) are still missing images of many influential women, especially black, brown and indigenous women.

That's why Whose Knowledge and the IIIF Consortium would like to invite you to join and become a partner for the VisibleWikiWomen 2020 campaign!

The campaign' partners include women's and feminist organizations, cultural and memory institutions, Wikipedia editors, Wikimedia user groups, chapters, and anyone who would like to give notable women the visibility and acknowledgment they deserve. If you're interested, connect with your hosts or send an email to Mariana Fossatti, the campaign coordinator at [visiblewikiwomen@whoseknowledge.org](mailto:visiblewikiwomen@whoseknowledge.org) to learn more about this partnership.

Here are a few ways a partner can support the campaign:
-   Upload freely licensed images to Wikimedia Commons using the [campaign page](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Campaign:VisibleWikiWomen) or using the [VisibleWikiWomen 2020 category](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:VisibleWikiWomen_2020) on the platform
-   Amplify social media posts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram using the hashtag #VisibleWikiWomen2020 and #WomenofColors
-   Organize a [photothon event in your community](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Learning_patterns/How_to_join_VisibleWikiWomen_as_a_campaign_organizer_in_your_local_context)
-   Partner with a local Wikipedia organization to feature #VisibleWikiWomen during their March/April edit-a-thons
-   Write joint blog posts with the Whose Knowledge? team to raise awareness about women's invisibility online

If you would like to learn more about the campaign and get some extra-support from WhoseKnowledge?, you can join one of their partners' calls hosted in 3 different time zones. If you are interested, get in touch with IIIF-C Staff via [staff@iiif.io](mailto:staff@iiif.io) for timing info.
