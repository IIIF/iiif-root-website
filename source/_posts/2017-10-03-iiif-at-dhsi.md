## About the IIIF Workshop at DHSI 2018

**Introduction to IIIF: Sharing, Consuming, and Annotating the World’s Images**  
Instructors: Jeffrey C. Witt, Drew Winget, Jack Reed, Sheila Rabun, and Benjamin Albritton  
June 4-8, 2018

Access to image-based resources is fundamental to research, scholarship and the transmission of cultural knowledge. Digital images are a container for much of the information content in the Web-based delivery of images, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials. Yet much of the Internet’s image-based resources are locked up in silos, with access restricted to bespoke, locally built applications. A growing community of the world’s leading research libraries and image repositories have embarked on an effort to collaboratively produce an interoperable technology and community framework for image delivery. IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) has the following goals: To give scholars an unprecedented level of uniform and rich access to image-based resources hosted around the world, To define a set of common application programming interfaces that support interoperability between image repositories, and To develop, cultivate and document shared technologies, such as image servers and web clients, that provide a world-class user experience in viewing, comparing, manipulating and annotating images.” (http://iiif.io). This course will introduce students to the basic concepts and technologies that make IIIF possible, allowing for guided, hands-on experience in installing servers and clients that support IIIF, and utilizing the advanced functionality that IIIF provides for interactive image-based research, such as annotation.

_This is a hands-on course. Consider this offering in complement with, and / or to be built on by: Advanced TEI Concepts / TEI Customization; Digital Documentation and Imaging for Humanists; Conceptualising and Creating a Digital Documentary Edition; A Collaborative Approach to XSLT; Geographical Information Systems in the Digital Humanities; and more!_

## About the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)

The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is a set of shared application programming interface (API) specifications for interoperable functionality in digital image repositories. IIIF is driven by a community of libraries, museums, archives, software companies, and other organizations working together to create, test, refine, implement and promote the IIIF specifications. Using JSON-LD, linked data, and standard W3C web protocols such as Web Annotation, IIIF makes it easy to parse and share digital image data, migrate across technology systems, and provide enhanced access to digital images for scholars and researchers. IIIF gives users a rich set of baseline functionality for viewing, zooming, and assembling the best mix of resources and tools to view, compare, annotate, and manipulate and work with images on the Web, an experience made portable–shareable, citable, and embeddable. For more information, please see the [IIIF FAQ][faq].



## About DHSI

The Digital Humanities Summer Institute provides an ideal environment for discussing and learning about new computing technologies and how they are influencing teaching, research, dissemination, creation, and preservation in different disciplines, via a community-based approach. A time of intensive coursework, seminars, and lectures, participants at DHSI share ideas and methods, and develop expertise in using advanced technologies. Every summer, the institute brings together faculty, staff, and students from the Arts, Humanities, Library, and Archives communities as well as independent scholars and participants from areas beyond. Described by one participant as an event that “combines the best aspects of a skills workshop, international conference, and summer camp,” the DHSI prides itself on its friendly, informal, and collegial atmosphere.
