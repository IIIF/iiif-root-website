We are very pleased to announce that Megan O'Hearn will be joining the staff of the IIIF Consortium on February 24 as the Community and Event Coordinator. Meg will serve as a coordinator, communicator, and facilitator, working with the entire IIIF community to help advance the framework and its utility, and she'll also serve a critical role in the organization and support of IIIF events, in-person and online.

Meg comes to us from ITHAKA, where she served as Senior Product Marketing Manager, working with digital image repositories and their associated communities and cultivating extensive skills in communications, event development, and community engagement.

She has also worked with international library and museum communities as a volunteer with Art+Feminism, a nonprofit campaign to improve coverage of gender, feminism, and the arts on Wikipedia.

Please give a warm welcome when you see Meg on upcoming calls and events, and many thanks to the members of the Hiring Committee who participated in the process.
