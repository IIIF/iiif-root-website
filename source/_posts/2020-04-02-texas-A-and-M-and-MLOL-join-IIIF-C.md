We are excited to announce the addition of two new members to the [IIIF Consortium][consortium]: Texas A&M has joined as a full member of the IIIF Consortium, and MediaLibraryOnLine (known as MLOL, developed by Horizons Unlimited srl) is the newest associate member. This brings the IIIF Consortium membership to a total of 57 institutions worldwide.

Texas A&M University Libraries house a rich array of resources assembled to support the research, learning and teaching at Texas A&M University. Made up of five unique libraries, the University Libraries serve the entire student and faculty population at Texas A&M with physical and online resources and services. The University Libraries also provide expertise in almost all majors on campus and create areas that allow students to work individually and collaboratively, and give instruction on research processes, helping all scholars find a path that leads to discovery, creativity and innovation. To learn more about the services and materials available visit <http://library.tamu.edu>.

“We see IIIF as a unifying standard that helps bring together all our digital assets, from manuscripts to images to audio/video” says Michael W. Bolton, Assistant Dean for Digital Initiatives at the Texas A&M University Libraries.  “The IIIF community is vibrant and growing with new tools being developed all the time, tools that open digital assets to more extensive research and study.”

MLOL is the first Italian network of public, academic and scholastic libraries for digital lending. To date, this network includes more than 6,000 libraries from 20 Italian regions and 9 foreign countries. In December, MLOL debuted the Estense Digital Library, with full IIIF integration for digitized materials. Its main goal in the coming years is to extend all the IIIF tools for free to Italian libraries and MLOL users and to invest in developing new applications for managing IIIF annotation/comparison/story creation tools with increasing levels of complexity. Specific attention has been devoted to annotation and content creation tools for scholars, teachers and general users. To learn more about MLOL visit <https://www.medialibrary.it/>

Welcome and congratulations to both Texas A&M and MLOL!
