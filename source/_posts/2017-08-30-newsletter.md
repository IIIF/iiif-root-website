## Technical Work

### IIIF Presentation 3.0 and A/V Technical Specification
The [IIIF A/V Technical Specification Group][av-group] continues to discuss issues related to [IIIF Presentation API version 3.0][presi3] which will include a canvas time dimension and other adjustments to accommodate A/V resources within the existing framework. Experimentation for IIIF A/V is underway with [proof of concept tests in the Avalon Media System][avalon-poc] (see a [demo][avalon-demo]), an open source A/V resource management software developed and maintained by Northwestern University and Indiana University libraries, based on Samvera and Fedora technologies. [Proof of concept tests][masahide] have been constructed by Masahide Kanzaki, an expert in Linked Open Data (LOD) and author of several textbooks on LOD in Japan. The British Library is also [experimenting with IIIF A/V][bl-poc]. As part of the ongoing “Save Our Sounds” project at the British Library, with a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, representatives from the IIIF A/V Technical Specification Group will be meeting in September at the Getty Center in Los Angeles to review progress and discuss next steps. The group will meet again at the [IIIF Working Meeting in Toronto][toronto], October 11-13. Updates from the IIIF A/V Technical Specification Group can be found on the [IIIF Discuss email list][iiif-discuss]. Independent experiments are encouraged and the group welcomes any and all feedback via the email list.

### Discovery of IIIF Resources
The [IIIF Discovery Technical Specification Group][discovery-group] recently finished a review of discovery-related use cases in the [iiif-stories GitHub][iiif-stories] repository, to refine the scope of work. A recent survey by Brumfield Labs of the various ways in which linking properties are being used in manifests across the IIIF community has revealed a need for clarified documentation in version 3.0 of the IIIF Presentation API. The group is working towards identifying a preferred mechanism for crawling and harvesting IIIF collections and objects, and will make plans for moving forward at the [IIIF Working Meeting in Toronto][toronto], October 11-13. Work on formalizing the import of IIIF resources into viewers from existing discovery environments is planned for the fall.

### IIIF Text Granularity Technical Specification Group
The [IIIF Text Granularity Technical Specification Group][textgran], chaired by Peter Binkley (University of Alberta) and Michael Appleby (Yale Center for British Art), has established a bi-weekly call schedule (every other Tuesday at 1pm Eastern, see [group page][textgran] for details) for focused work on specifying levels of granularity for annotations. After comparing the general granularity structure and requirements of various OCR outputs, the group plans to test multiple OCR extraction processes and outputs, map them onto IIIF manifests,  and compare results. The group will meet in person at the [IIIF Working Meeting in Toronto][toronto].

### OpenJPEG Improvement Project
The [OpenJPEG improvement project][open-jpeg] is well underway, with [OpenJPEG v. 2.2.1][open-jpeg221] just released on August 9, 2017 as part of the collaborative effort to facilitate improvement of [OpenJPEG][openjpeg]. Project status can be tracked via [GitHub][openjpeg-github]. The project team welcomes additional funding institutions to contribute to future phases and sustain the effort to bring OpenJPEG up to speed with proprietary implementations of the JPEG 2000 standard. To learn more and get involved, please contact Glen Robson, IIIF Technical Coordinator, at <glen.robson@iiif.io>.

### IIIF Consulting: American Art Collaborative
The IIIF Consortium is partnering with the American Art Collaborative (AAC) to provide technical consulting for eight AAC museums as part of a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon foundation. In collaboration with Sara and Ben Brumfield of [Brumfield Labs][Brumfield-Labs], and Jason Ronallo, head of Digital Library Initiatives at NCSU Libraries, the museums will receive hands-on guidance and specific recommendations for implementing IIIF. The documentation and learnings from this engagement will be used to improve the [IIIF Quick Start Guide][quick-start] as well as launch a service for implementation consulting for future prospective adopters. For more info, contact Glen Robson at <admin@iiif.io>.

## Community Groups:
IIIF Community groups are designed to provide a forum for general discussion, brainstorming, sharing of use cases and demos, and working to produce tutorials and presentations based on existing IIIF APIs. The process for forming Community Groups can be found at <http://iiif.io/community/groups/framework/>. Please see the [IIIF Community Groups page][groups] for a calendar of group and community calls, as well as links to more information about each group. All of the community groups will be meeting in person at the [2017 IIIF Working Meeting in Toronto][toronto], October 11-13.

### Manuscripts Community Group
In addition to a multitude of manuscript-related presentations, the [IIIF Manuscripts Community Group][manuscripts] held a two-hour meeting with over 45 people at the 2017 IIIF Conference in The Vatican. The group plans to focus on metadata and manifest best practices, outreach in the manuscripts community, and follow the work of the IIIF Text Granularity Specification Group. The IIIF Manuscripts group will meet in-person again at the 2017 IIIF Working Meeting in Toronto, October 11-13.

### Museums Community Group
The [IIIF Museums Community Group][museums] continues to hold a monthly call to discuss mutual topics of interest, including technical implementation, documentation, and outreach.  At the Vatican conference, the group’s conversation focused on topics related to multispectral imaging, image panoramas, and 3D. The next museums group call is Tuesday, September 5 - see the [group page][museums] for details.

### Newspapers Community Group
The [IIIF Newspapers Community Group][newspapers] met in person at the 2017 IIIF Conference in The Vatican to review the guidelines for best practices in newspapers and IIIF, discussed text granularity and automated article recognition, and shared demonstrations on what different institutions are currently working on. Group calls have moved to a quarterly schedule; the next call is scheduled for Wednesday, September 27. Stay tuned to [IIIF-Discuss][iiif-discuss] and the [IIIF Community Calendar][groups] for future call times.

### Software Developers Community Group
The [IIIF Software Developers Community Group][devs-group] met in person at the Vatican and had over 50 people attend the group meeting, with free-form discussion on various proposed use cases and pain points with implementations. The group call occurs once every four weeks, with a goal to focus on one topic at a time per call, so participants can join based on relevant topics. The group has just launched a [survey][software-survey] to gauge the current interests and status of the IIIF developer community.
