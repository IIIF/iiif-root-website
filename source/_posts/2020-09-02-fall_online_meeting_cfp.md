We are now accepting proposals for the IIIF Fall Working Meeting, which will take place on December 1-3, 2020. Submissions are due by September 22, 2020.

The Fall Working Meeting is a time for the community to work together on developing new directions or refining continuing projects. It is also intended to:
- Update the community on the status of different groups and the IIIF specs
- Provide collaborative time to make progress on elements critical to IIIF’s success and adoption
- Allow participants to inform the direction of IIIF efforts
- Welcome those newer to IIIF to get more involved with shaping the community

Proposals should be for topics that can be covered within two days of online meetings (the total amount of time you’d like to spend is flexible), and can focus on anything IIIF-related needing attention. This could include topics such as Cookbook recipe development, new group formation, initiating local or regional community projects, and more. Meetings will take place on Zoom.

Please enter submissions in the form:

We will send a second call for those interested in giving lightning talks at this event in October.

Reach out to us at <staff@iiif.io> with any questions.
