IIIF Week sessions will discuss digital strategy for cultural heritage, introduce IIIFâ€™s capabilities and community through introductory presentations and demonstrations of use cases, and explore the future of IIIF and digital research needs more broadly.

Newcomers and experienced IIIF implementers alike will find events scheduled at convenient times that allow attendees to form regional community connections in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and more.

Additionally, interested attendees may also sign up for a free workshop on getting started with IIIF the week following the conference. Participation is limited to 25, and is available on a first come, first served basis. Some experience with HTML and plain text editing is required.

Questions? Get in touch with IIIF staff at <events@iiif.io>. We look forward to seeing you in June!
