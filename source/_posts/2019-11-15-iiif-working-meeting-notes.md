The [IIIF Consortium][iiif-c] recently hosted a productive [IIIF Working Meeting last week in Ann Arbor Michigan][ann-arbor], and we are pleased to be able to share [a document with brief summaries of the sessions there and links to more specific notes][notes] taken during those sessions.

We also want to take this opportunity to thank all the folks that made the Working Meeting possible -- our local host partners at the University of Michigan Libraries, and at Artstor/Ithaka; our incredible Planning Committee that set the agenda for the meeting and the Showcase; and of course Glen Robson and Aliya Reich from IIIF-C and CLIR for putting in so many hours to make things run smoothly.
